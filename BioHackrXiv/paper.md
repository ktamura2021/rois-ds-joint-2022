# Abstract

Orthologous genes for five plant genes are obtained using several orthology finder tools and the results are compared with each other, to figure out the differences of those tools.

Keywords: Arabidopsis, Orthologs, Soybean

# Introduction

Among the various biological resources, ortholog information can play a central role in integrating the biological data of multiple species [@Chiba2015].

# Hackathon results

## Genes used for the analysis

We selected four genes from *A. thaliana* and one gene from *G. max* (Table 1) for the analysis. 
Add to this section a couple of paragraphs introducing the work done dring the BioHackathon, CodeFest, VoCamp or Sprint event. Please add references whenever needed, for instance [@Katayama:2010].

| NCBI Gene ID | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| item 1 | item 2 |
| item 3 | item 4 |

# Discussion

We compared the results from OMA, OrthoDB, PGDBj, and Ensembl Plants.

# Future work
The conclusion will be generalized to other genes of plant species.
The orthology relations will be used in RefEx service.

## Tables, figures and so on

Please remember to introduce tables (see Table 1) before they appear on the document. We recommend to center tables, formulas and figure but not the corresponding captions. Feel free to modify the table style as it better suits to your data.

Table 1
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| item 1 | item 2 |
| item 3 | item 4 |

Remember to introduce figures (see Figure 1) before they appear on the document.

# Jupyter notebooks, GitHub repositories and data repositories

* Please add a list here
* Make sure you let us know which of these correspond to Jupyter notebooks. Although not supported yet, we plan to add features for them
* And remember, software and data need a license for them to be used by others, no license means no clear rules so nobody could legally use a non-licensed research object, whatever that object is
